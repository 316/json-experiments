Json test
=========

Some simple test to find out how to work out with json data.

Content
=======

There's:

- Json example file with some records
- several index files ordered by complexity


How does it work?
=================

It doesn't, just load index files and see how that works.

For example:

* index.html just loads the full content of the json file.

* index1.html shows the name of a json record based on the id input

* index3 adds complete rows to a table based on id input

TODO
====

Some complex operations like:

* performing additions on listed element prices
* dynamic search
* ammount validation
* make it work on web2py ;D
* sepparate js and html files
